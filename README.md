# train_hard

I'm new to deep learning. I'm now use Keras and Tensorflow as backend.

I use some real stock market data as my exercise. 

You can download the data from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3zSzVUgsG-FNTliNFl2a2t5dzQ/view?usp=sharing

It is more than 600M bytes. 

After downloding the file, please extract it in the train_hard directory and run the train.py.

Here is my problem:
When training, I always got nan in loss in first several epochs, even I set lr = 1e-4. 
I don't know why. Are theer any black magic in training deep neural network? 
Please give me some advicees. Since I am new in this area, any advice is welcome.

Thanks in advance!
